# OS Installation using iDRAC9 Web Interface using Remote File Share

This outlines the detailed steps to install an Operating System(OS) on a server using Dellâ€™s iDRAC9 web interface using the Remote File Sharing method.

## Prerequisites

1. **iDRAC Login Credentials**: Ensure you have access to iDRAC9, incase you do not have the credentials, ask in the [OPI Slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/opi-project/shared_invite/zt-1ctqtrgkz-WJZrcVPp3P1ACZWjpZP2KQ).
2. **OS ISO File**: The Operating System ISO image should be available on the Network or a Remote File System and be accessible to the iDRAC system. The current Ubuntu ISO we are using is available at: `http://172.22.0.1/ubuntu-22.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso`. Please see [here](hosting_files_on_webserver.md) to understand how the ISO file is hosted on the web server.
3. **VPN Access**: Confirm you have a VPN connection to ensure, you can connect to the server's iDRAC interface.
4. **Supported Browsers**: Use the latest version of a supported web browser for the best experience (e.g., Chrome).

### Step 2: Connect the Remote File Sharing to iDRAC

1. Once you are successfully logged in to iDRAC console, Under configuration, go to **Virtual Media**.
2. Scroll down to go to **Remote File Share 1** or **Remote File Share 2**
3. Under **Remote File Share** fill out the details regarding the ISO file, like its path/address, username, password, SSL certificate (only the address is mandatory, rest are dependednt on the File Sharing system setup)
4. Once you have successfully filled out the parameters, click on connect and you will be able to see if iDRAC is able to connect or not.
5. Incase iDRAC is not able to access the ISO file, it shows an error to enter the correct details.

### Step 3: Launch the Virtual Console

1. From the iDRAC dashboard, navigate and launch the **Virtual Console** from the bottom right of the iDRAC dashboard and ensure you have the browser popups turned on.
